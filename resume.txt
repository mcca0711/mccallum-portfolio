PROFILE
================================================================================

Full-stack developer who transitioned into software after years in construction, where I repeatedly saw inefficiencies and failure modes that code could solve better than any tool in my belt. I now build AI-integrated production applications with the same mindset: ship systems that work in the mess of the real world. I specialize in FastAPI, Vue.js, and Python backends with GenAI integrations, including RAG pipelines, voice transcription, and automated reporting. Active Secret Security Clearance, with experience delivering secure systems for government and enterprise environments.

BACKGROUND
================================================================================

Construction (2008-2020): 12 years managing crews, coordinating across trades, and delivering physical projects under real constraints. Transitioned to software development to solve the inefficiencies I saw every day - bringing project management discipline, troubleshooting instincts, and a bias toward solutions that survive contact with reality.
