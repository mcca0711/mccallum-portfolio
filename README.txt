=================================================

How to run locally
------------------
1) Unzip this folder.
2) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it).
   - Or use a simple server: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit http://localhost:8000

Deploy to GitHub Pages
----------------------
1) Create a new repository (or use your existing one).
2) Copy ALL files and folders to the repo root and commit.
3) In repo settings → Pages, select the default branch with root directory.
4) Your site will publish shortly.

Customize
---------
- Edit text in the HTML files.
- Replace images in `assets/images/` with your own screenshots (SVGs provided are high-res and light).
- Update colors/fonts in `assets/css/style.css`.
- `resume.html` is ATS-friendly and prints cleanly (use the Print button).
- `resume.txt` is included for portals that require plain text resume.

Notes
-----
- No project links point to GitHub (as requested).
- Emphasis is on AI developer / AI product / automation specialist positioning across pages.
